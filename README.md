# Machine learning Challenge

---

### Overview
This project comprises two related tasks aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to handle noise in datasets. The tasks involve generating noisy data, preprocessing it, and applying machine learning models to either classify or remove the noise effectively.

---

### Task 1: Multi-Label Classification Using Machine Learning
This task focuses on multi-label classification using machine learning.

#### File Details
- Use the provided notebook `Task 1.ipynb`.

#### Instructions
1. Load the data
2. Convert your labels y into a multi-label format, by creating two columns:
    - Odd or Not: This column indicates whether the label is odd (True) or not (False).
    - Greater Than 5: This column indicates whether the label is greater than 5 (True) or not (False).
3. Implement a machine learning model of your choice to perform multi-label classification.
4. Evaluate your model.

### Task 2: Noise Removal Using Machine Learning
This task focuses on identifying and removing noise from datasets using machine learning.

#### File Details
- Use the provided notebook `Task 2.ipynb`.

#### Instructions
1. Use a random generation method to introduce noise into your dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset.
3. Implement a machine learning model that suit the problem.
4. Evaluate your model.
